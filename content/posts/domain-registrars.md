On the occasion of the shutdown of Google Domains, Gergely Orosz made a nice
[overview of domain
registrars](https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/domain-registrars-which-developers-recommend)
which are popular among developers.

The most interesting
are [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com), [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com),
and [Porkbun](https://porkbun.com). All of them seem to have low prices and good
service.

Cloudflare is particularly praised for their security features and their clean
interface.

Namecheap has been particularly popular on Hacker News for a long time. Their
interface is reported to be a bit outdated, but that's not necessarily a bad
thing. They also recently started the [spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com)
brand with a more modern interface and a focus on selling hosting services
together with domains.

For Porkbun, besides the low prices and the neat settings interface, the English
speaking in-house support gets a special mention.
